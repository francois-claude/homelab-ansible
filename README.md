# Homelab Ansible Configuration

## Purpose
These are the yaml configuration files used to manage my personal homelab. Scripts and playbooks deploy and harden containers and virtual machines via ssh.

## Ansible 
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. 

Ansible was written by Michael DeHaan and acquired by Red Hat in 2015. Ansible is agentless, temporarily connecting remotely via SSH or Windows Remote Management (allowing remote PowerShell execution) to do its tasks.
